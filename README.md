# learning

A space where I put small projects to learn new programming languages.

  * `clang`: is to learn `C`. Well actually I have been a `C` and `C++` developer in the past days, but I am talking about 27 years ago. I do not remember nothing. So this is just a way to learn, have fun, etc... with `C`
